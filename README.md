I chose to answer the Query Engine question.

The entry point is at Program.Main where I have created a sample data source instance
using the Data class and a test SQL query.

The method "PrintResultsOfQuery" is the beginning of the engine I was requested to 
write, it recieves the SQL query and the Data instance as parameters.

Note: I wasn't able to determine which List to choose from the Data instance based
on the source name from the query therefore I assumed that all queries request data 
from the Users list.
